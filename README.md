# foodfindr-website
[ foodfindr ](https://github.com/eric-li18/foodfindr) responsive landing page made with HTML and Bootstrap.
Includes a Newsletter feature using mailchimp's REST api integrated with express.js.

## WIP
Future plans to possibly move to build the static site with node, with Travis-CI and Docker integration so as to bypass development environment setup.
